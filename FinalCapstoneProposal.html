					<P>Kimberly Nowell-Berry</P>

					</H2>
					<P>For my final capstone in the Thinkful Data Science Course, I
					will be implementing multiple models in attempt estimate the
					probability of sequences in computer log activity. I will
					determine the likelihood that a user follows a particular path.</P>
					<P>When a malicious user or attacker attacks a network, there
					are generally traces of this behavior left behind in the form of
					logs, whether these are endpoint logs, e.g., Windows or Linux
					Operating system event, access and security logs, network based
					logs, e.g., Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), netflow logs,
					firewall logs, router logs, or application logs, e.g.,
					HypterText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) web server logs, database
					logs, etc. With the multiple different logs, identification of a
					malicious user is difficult, and anomaly detection plays a
					critical role in identifying malicious behavior.</P>
					<P>While anomaly detection identifies interesting events in
					these logs, it is typically not sufficient individually to
					determine whether or not a particular event is actually
					malicious. In order to just that, multiple individual anomalous
					events that can be correlated together provide a strong
					indication that actual malicious activity is present. 
					</P>
					<P>In this Capstone, I will identify anomalous activity in log
					data using multiple anomaly detection techniques, including but
					not limited to Kalman Filters and time series anomaly detection,
					relate those back to tactics, and use a Markov chain to predict
					the probability that a user performed those activities.
					Probabilities that are very low would indicate that that
					sequence of events has happened and would be a strong indication
					that an attack has occurred. This utility of this model is
					two-fold:

						together automatically reduces the human requirement to
						manually pull these events together, freeing security analysts
						to perform other tasks</P>
						<LI><P>Providing the probability of a particular sequence being
						followed can aide in attribution of specific attacks, which is
						real-world, hard problem</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For this Capstone, I will be using the
sample data available from Carnegie Mellon's Software Engineering
Institute.  The data consists of email, http, network logon events,
and others.  The data contains specific attacks that have been
identified in separate answer keys so that results can be validated
against the true results.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This data will be downloaded and
imported into dataframes for analysis.</P>

<H2 CLASS="western">Challenges</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The biggest challenge I anticipate is
achieving good results.  This is an experient to determine whether
the theory of mapping the individual anomaly detection results to a
Markov chain for predictive capabilities is viable solution to this
problem.  If so, this would be significant contribution to Threat
Hunting in the CyberSecurity field.</P>
