    "\n",
    "The data used for this project is the Enron email corpus.  We will train this model and try to identify unique emails out of the data set.  Specifically, we look at the sent emails from each user.  This way, the texts can be labeled to be identified to unique users.\n",

    "\n",
    "I didn't do that, and I ultimately did it the hard way by downloading the originals and traversing the path.  The data in the link from Kaggle is already formatted for you, which would've made this whole thing a lot easier, but you live and learn."
